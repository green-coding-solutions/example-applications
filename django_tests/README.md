## Intro

This is an example on how to run tests and profile them. In this example we use the django framework and
run all the tests they provide to see how much resources testing takes.


## Building

Run `docker compose build` to build the containers and use them for testing or
instrumented by the Green Metrics Tool runner.


## Using this container for development

Run `docker compose run bash` to start and enter the container.

It will just end when you just do `docker compose run`
