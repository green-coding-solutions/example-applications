# Introduction

This is an example on how to run `stress-ng` in our tool and see how the CPU behaves.
Very much like the example in `../stress` this example stesses the CPU except it uses 10 cores.

## Building

Run `docker compose -f ../shared/stress/compose.yml build` to build the containers and use them for testing or
instrumented by the Green Metrics Tool runner.

Please note that the `compose.yml` file is a symlink into the `../shared/stress/` folder!

## Using this container for development

Run `docker compose run stress` to start and enter the container.

It will just end when you just do `docker compose run`
